        I'm Terje, a software developer based in Norway with a passion for technology. I love exploring new programming
        languages to understand their strengths and patterns. Also enjoy diving into deeper topics like compilers and
        software architecture, and over-engineering home projects to gain hands-on experience.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        My career started with helpdesk work, where I gained broad experience from debugging applications to replacing
        hardware. At Intility, where I've spent most of my career, I discovered my love for networking through Cisco's
        CCNA certification, a foundation that has shaped my professional journey.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Networking led me to automation tools like Ansible and programming with Python, which sparked a passion that
        continues today. Now I build platforms using Kubernetes and Crossplane to manage network routers. I especially
        enjoy working with YANG and gNMI, which combine networking and programming, bringing together my experience and
        interests.
