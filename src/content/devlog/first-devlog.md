My first ever devlog entry! Fittingly, it's about the creation of this website.

This weekend I wanted to do something different from what I've been doing lately, so I decided to build a personal website. At first I made it in React with modern libraries, which worked fine, and I built basically the same thing you see here. But it took much more effort, and Astro seemed like a simpler option.

This page is therefore a complete Astro app, and I think it looks good! I've learned a lot about both React/Astro, and also about frontend development in general. Before this, I hadn't spent much time trying to understand tools like TailwindCSS, but now I see how much it improves productivity, especially if you don't know CSS very well.

Overall Astro have been really nice to work with, and I will definitely use it in the future if I need to write a documentation website or other static content. I also used GitHub Pages, which was a seamless way of hosting it, definitely worth considering for similar projects.

It was a successful weekend, and now I have everything I need to start writing more proper blog posts too. We'll see how that goes.
